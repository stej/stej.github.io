      <description>This was a question that I wanted to post on reddit. Howeve, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough reputation, so the post was deleted. So I&amp;rsquo;ll repost here&amp;hellip;
Background - I have some coins in my portfolio. I bought some, I sold some and now I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether my decisions were good or bad. Or whatever. What is my percentage gain?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a coin XYZ. You buy and sell regularly and you would like to know whether you have gained something or lost (in percentage).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while when I saw a blog post My Ultimate PowerShell prompt with Oh My Posh and the Windows Terminal. You know, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty comfortable to let the link open in a tab and close it after several weeks/months. Not now. I spend quite some tim in PowerShell console and I customized my prompt in the past, so I wanted to give it a try.
The installation is pretty straightforward.</description>

      <description>Dealing with $nulls in PowerShell is quite tricky sometimes. Or better - it was. Has that changed?
Let&amp;rsquo;s create some a helper function first that can describe the passed object. Simple, but good enough for this blog post.
function dumpobj { param($obj) function dumpit { param($o, $indent) if ($null -eq $o) { Write-Host (&amp;#34; &amp;#34; * $indent) &amp;#39;null&amp;#39; } elseif ($o -is [array]) { Write-Host (&amp;#34; &amp;#34; * $indent) &amp;#39;Array: count=&amp;#39; $o.</description>

      <description>In short:
 CR is the escape character \r (carriage return, 0x0D, 13 in decimal) LF is the escape character \n (line feed, 0x0A, 10 in decimal)  First let&amp;rsquo;s make two files for testing. One file with CRLF and one with LF.
mkdir c:\temp\ -EA SilentlyContinue cd c:\temp ([byte[]][char[]]&amp;#34;some&amp;#34;) + ([byte[]] (13,10)) + ([byte[]][char[]]&amp;#34;testing&amp;#34;) | Set-Content fileCrLf.txt -asByte ([byte[]][char[]]&amp;#34;some&amp;#34;) + [byte]10 + ([byte[]][char[]]&amp;#34;testing&amp;#34;) | Set-Content fileLf.txt -asByte Is there any difference when reading the file?</description>

      <description>(This is just a first blog post.)
Some time ago I had a blog with technical informations. It was 10 years ago. As time went by I was trying to put more and more information into that. So it started to be very time consuming then. What happened? You guess. I gave up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to publish some posts that are either incomplete or I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% convinced about the content.</description>
