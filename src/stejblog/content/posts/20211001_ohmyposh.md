description: Ever wanted to have a nice prompt in PowerShell?
---

It's been a while when I saw a blog post [My Ultimate PowerShell prompt with Oh My Posh and the Windows Terminal](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/my-ultimate-powershell-prompt-with-oh-my-posh-and-the-windows-terminal). You know, it's pretty comfortable to let the link open in a tab and close it after several weeks/months. Not now. I spend quite some tim in PowerShell console and I customized my prompt in the past, so I wanted to give it a try.

The installation is pretty straightforward. Nothing too surprising. What's interesting here is how it works. 

## Some internals
If you look at the module structure, you see standard `psd1` and `psm1` files. But if you look into that `psm1` file and want to find e.g. what's inside `Enable-PoshTooltips`, you get nothing. Simply you can't find it. 
But if you try to look for that string via fulltext search in the directory (`C:\Users\.....\Modules\oh-my-posh\5.6.4\`), you will find it in some weird binaries. 

That's right. All the magic is hidden in the binary file. It's `bin\posh-windows-amd64.exe` in my case. The binary itself is written in go, look [here](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/src/main.go). And then if you would like to 
find the script with `$prompt` function, simply run that like this:

```
posh-windows-amd64.exe -shell pwsh -print-init > init.ps1
```

and you get this code:

```
# Powershell doesn't default to UTF8 just yet, so we're forcing it as there are too many problems
# that pop up when we don't
[console]::InputEncoding = [console]::OutputEncoding = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding
$env:POWERLINE_COMMAND = "oh-my-posh"
$env:CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER = $false

....

[ScriptBlock]$Prompt = {
    #store if the last command was successful
    $lastCommandSuccess = $?
    #store the last exit code for restore
    $realLASTEXITCODE = $global:LASTEXITCODE
    $omp = "C:/Users/j.stefan/OneDrive - Quadient/Documents/PowerShell/Modules/oh-my-posh/5.6.4/bin/posh-windows-amd64.exe"
    $config, $cleanPWD, $cleanPSWD = Get-PoshContext
    if ($global:PoshSettings.Transient -eq $true) {
        $standardOut = @(&$omp --pwd="$cleanPWD" --pswd="$cleanPSWD" --config="$config" --print-transient 2>&1)
        $standardOut -join "`n"
        $global:PoshSettings.Transient = $false
        return
    }
    $errorCode = 0
    Initialize-ModuleSupport
    Set-PoshContext
    if ($lastCommandSuccess -eq $false) {
        #native app exit code
        if ($realLASTEXITCODE -is [int] -and $realLASTEXITCODE -gt 0) {
            $errorCode = $realLASTEXITCODE
        }
        else {
            $errorCode = 1
        }
    }

    # read stack count from current stack(if invoked from profile=right value,otherwise use the global variable set in Set-PoshPrompt(stack scoped to module))
    $stackCount = (Get-Location -stack).Count
    try {
        if ($global:omp_global_sessionstate -ne $null) {
            $stackCount = ($global:omp_global_sessionstate).path.locationstack('').count
        }
    }
    catch {}

    $executionTime = -1
    $history = Get-History -ErrorAction Ignore -Count 1
    if ($null -ne $history -and $null -ne $history.EndExecutionTime -and $null -ne $history.StartExecutionTime -and $global:omp_lastHistoryId -ne $history.Id) {
        $executionTime = ($history.EndExecutionTime - $history.StartExecutionTime).TotalMilliseconds
        $global:omp_lastHistoryId = $history.Id
    }
    $standardOut = @(&$omp --error="$errorCode" --pwd="$cleanPWD" --pswd="$cleanPSWD" --execution-time="$executionTime" --stack-count="$stackCount" --config="$config" 2>&1)
    # make sure PSReadLine knows we have a multiline prompt
    $extraLines = $standardOut.Count - 1
    if ($extraLines -gt 0) {
        Set-PSReadlineOption -ExtraPromptLineCount $extraLines
    }
    # the output can be multiline, joining these ensures proper rendering by adding line breaks with `n
    $standardOut -join "`n"
    $global:LASTEXITCODE = $realLASTEXITCODE
    #remove temp variables
    Remove-Variable realLASTEXITCODE -Confirm:$false
    Remove-Variable lastCommandSuccess -Confirm:$false
}

....

function global:Enable-PoshTooltips {
    Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key SpaceBar -ScriptBlock {
        [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::Insert(' ')
        $position = $host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition
        $omp = "C:/Users/j.stefan/OneDrive - Quadient/Documents/PowerShell/Modules/oh-my-posh/5.6.4/bin/posh-windows-amd64.exe"
        $config, $cleanPWD, $cleanPSWD = Get-PoshContext
        $command = $null
        $cursor = $null
        [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::GetBufferState([ref]$command, [ref]$cursor)
        $standardOut = @(&$omp --pwd="$cleanPWD" --pswd="$cleanPSWD" --config="$config" --command="$command" 2>&1)
        Write-Host $standardOut -NoNewline
        $host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition = $position
    }
}

...

```

So basically everything that can be displayed, has to be passed to that executable. Look at the [themes](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes). You can print a lot of information - OS, git status, battery info, spotify status, execution time, ... In other words - you can print everything, that either
- go program can read from OS or disk
- or is passed to that go program from powershell (execution time, errors, ...)

If you would like to have something more advanced/custom, you have an option - block [called command](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/command). So if you e.g. want to see price of bitcoin when you hit `b<space>` in your console, you need
1. enable the *tooltips* via `Enable-PoshTooltips`
2. add this to your profile:

    ```
    "tooltips": [
        {
        "type": "command",
        "tips": ["btc", "b"],
        "style": "diamond",
        "foreground": "black",
        "background": "green",
        "properties": {
            "shell": "bash",
            "command": " curl \"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd\" -s "
        }
    }]
    ```

And the result?
