*(This is just a first blog post.)*

Some time ago I had a blog with technical informations. It was 10 years ago. As time went by I was trying to put more and more information into that. So it started to be very time consuming then.
What happened? You guess. I gave up. I didn't want to publish some posts that are either incomplete or I'm not 100% convinced about the content.

This year I also didn't renew the domain registration, so it's over.

But I still see some potential in writing a blog. 
Why? Because I found out that I reinvent some thoughts and techniques over and over again. And if I write about it, there is a chance, it digs into my brain so deep that I won't ever forget that.
