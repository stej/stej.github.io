    <div class="content">
      <p>This was a question that I wanted to post on reddit. Howeve, I didn&rsquo;t have enough reputation, so the post was deleted. So I&rsquo;ll repost here&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Background - I have some coins in my portfolio. I bought some, I sold some and now I don&rsquo;t know whether my decisions were good or bad. Or whatever. What is my percentage gain?</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a coin XYZ. You buy and sell regularly and you would like to know whether you have gained something or lost (in percentage). How would you count that?</p>
<p>My calculations look pretty simple. Let&rsquo;s say I have a table (hour by hour) with my trades (buy/sell) and the price of XYZ coin. Pretty simple sample:</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/images/20211015_simple1.png" alt="Simple sample"  />
</p></p>
<p>Row 1: I buy at 00:00:00 <strong>100</strong> coins, the coin price is <strong>10</strong>, total spent is <strong>1000$</strong> and percentage gain <strong>0</strong> (I just bought that).</p>
<p>Row 2: Hour later the price is <strong>12</strong>. I have spent still <strong>1000$</strong> so far and I still have <strong>100</strong> XYZ coins. If I would buy now, when the price is <strong>12</strong> instead of when the price was <strong>10</strong>, I would get <strong>83.3</strong> coins.
But I have <strong>100</strong> coins, not <strong>83.3</strong>, so I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m in green numbers obviously. My percentage gain is <strong>20%</strong> (computed like 100/83.3*100 - 100).</p>
<p>Row 3: the same.</p>
<p>Row 4: the same principle. I spent another <strong>1000$</strong>. Now I have 100+1000/15 = <strong>166.6</strong> XYZ coins. But if I would spent all the money now (all money is <strong>2000$</strong>), I would get 2000/15=<strong>133.3</strong> XYZ coins. But I have <strong>166.6</strong>. So my gain in % is 166.6/133.3*100 - 100 = <strong>24.9%</strong>.</p>
<p>So I bought at rows 1, 4, 15, for prices <strong>10</strong>, <strong>15</strong>, <strong>15</strong>.</p>
<p>The principle is pretty clear and works also when I&rsquo;m in red numbers (see row 17, the price dropped to <strong>10</strong>). I would get <strong>300</strong> XYZ coins for all the money spent so far (<strong>3000$</strong>), but I have only <strong>233.2</strong> XYZ coins. That means I lost 233.2/300*100 - 100 = <strong>-22%</strong>.</p>
<p>That would work fine if I don&rsquo;t sell anything.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s suppose you are pretty good and you buy low and sell high.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/images/20211015_simple2.png" alt="Simple sample"  />
</p></p>
<p>You buy <strong>100</strong> XYZ coins for 1000$**. Then wait and hodl.</p>
<p>At row 11 you decide to sell the XYZ coins for <strong>2000$</strong>. That means that you got <strong>2000$</strong>, but you have still <strong>20</strong> XYZ coins in your wallet.</p>
<p>Now the math is screwed up. You see that your gain at row 11 is <strong>-150%</strong>, which is nonsense. You are not in red numbers. In fact, you are totally green. You gained a lot of money and you still have some XYZ coins in your pocket.
How would you express that so that the numbers are comparable?</p>
<p>I have some coins where I buy/sell often, and some which I basically only hodl and I would like to compare the performance.</p>
<p>&ndash; thanks, if you got here. I know this is long post ;)</p>
<p>(btw. I use Julia for the computations, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun)</p>
